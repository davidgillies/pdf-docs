# Documentation

This Repo contains the Project Documentation for each project in PDFs.  Each project has its own docs folder with the docs rendered in Markdown which will render in Github.  There is also a Project Documentation repo that uses Mkdocs and can build a full HTML navigable and searchable website from the documentation (See the project_docs repo).
